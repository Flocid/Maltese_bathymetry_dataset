# Maltese Bathymetry Dataset

## Introduction
The Maltese Bathymetry Dataset is a centralized database that compiles scientific research and publications on the geology and morphology of the seafloor around the Maltese Islands.

## Dataset Compilation
In this study, various seafloor forms in the study area were extracted. The dataset is a result of meticulous examination and organization of shapefiles using QGIS.

## Seafloor Forms
The dataset includes the following seafloor forms:

- Fault Escarpments
- Palaeoshorelines
- Trawl Marks
- Canyon Main Axes
- Canyon Tributaries
- Pockmarks
- Volcanic Bodies
- Canyons
- Bedrock Reefs
- Mounds
- Mud Volcanoes
- Ridge
- Channels
- Horsts
- Mass Movement Scars and Deposits
- Contouritic Drifts
- Re-entrants
- Scours
- Solution Subsidence Structures

## Data Organization
The dataset includes shapefiles and GeoJSON files for feature preview, which provide a comprehensive view of the identified seafloor forms in the study.

## Geomorphological Processes
The study identifies seven key geomorphological processes contributing to the formation of the seafloor forms. These processes include erosional and depositional forces, tectonic activities, volcanic events, water currents, fluid migration, slope instability, and karst processes.

## Potential Hazards
This research also highlights potential hazards associated with seafloor forms, such as damage to submarine cables and pipes, landslides causing flooding, erosion hazards, sediment build-up, and rock instability.

## Recommendation
The study recommends further exploration, particularly in the western region of the Maltese Islands, including the Malta Graben, Sicily Channel, and Malta Plateau. Additionally, a comprehensive substrate database for the region could enhance understanding of seafloor changes over time.
