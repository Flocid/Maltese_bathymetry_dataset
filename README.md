# Maltese Bathymetry Dataset

This repository hosts the Maltese Bathymetry Dataset, a centralized collection of seafloor data around the Maltese Islands. The project addresses the limited scope of previous studies, offering a comprehensive understanding of various seafloor forms and their contributing mechanisms.

## Project Overview

The dataset comprises information on 19 distinct seafloor forms in the study area, extracted from existing scientific research and publications. Geomorphological processes, including erosional and depositional forces, tectonic activities, and more, are identified.

## Data Compilation and Organization

Data compilation involved extracting information from the literature and organizing it using QGIS. Two essential formats are provided for your convenience:

- **GeoJSON for Feature Preview:** Explore a visual representation of the seafloor forms by checking the [GeoJSON preview](https://github.com/Flocid/Maltese_bathymetry_dataset/tree/main/GeoJSON).

- **Shapefiles:** The dataset is available in Shapefiles, containing crucial information on various seafloor forms. These files can be utilized for in-depth analysis using GIS software.

## Key Findings

Seven geomorphological processes contribute to the formation of the identified seafloor forms. Potential hazards, such as damage to infrastructure and geological risks, are highlighted.

## Recommendations and Future Work

The study recommends further exploration in the western region of the Maltese Islands, including the Malta Graben and the Sicily Channel. A comprehensive substrate database for the region and marine capital assessment are suggested for future research.
